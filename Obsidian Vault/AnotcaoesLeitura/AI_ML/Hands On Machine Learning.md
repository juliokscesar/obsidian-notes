# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning Systems
### Supervised Learning
The training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called *labels*.
*Classification* is a typical supervised learning task. 
Another example is to predict a *target* numeric value, such as the price of a car given a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc) called predictors. This sort of task is called *regression*, where you need to give the system many examples of cars, including both their predictions and their labels, in order to train it.

Some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
The training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a 'teacher'.
Some algorithms:
- Clustering
	- k-Means
	- Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
	- Expectation Maximization

- Visualization and dimensionality reduction
	- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	- Kernel PCA
	- Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
	- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

- Association rule learning
	- Apriori
	- Eclat


Visualization algorithms are also good examples of unsupervised learning algorithms: you feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can easily be plotted.
